In this README file, all the progress that has been made throughout the week will be noted here

# Week of May 19th
**Monday**
- Working on extracting agent and agent_id (if present) from texts
- Using NER (named entity recognization)
- Attempting to use spaCy, fuzzy and cosine similarity for NER
- Prototyping to find best results
---
**Tuesday**
- Using an agent list (that will be given by the user) for better results
- More tests - as this is a crucial step
- Finished preprocessing
- Looking for usuable data/brainstorming optimal way to get data
---
**Wednesday**
- Completed agent extraction, consistent results
- Began implementing model
- Labelling small dataset (20 or so)
---
**Thursday**
- Finished labelling dataset
- Working on implementation of model
---
**Friday**
- Checking different library run times and performance
- Working on limiting unnecessary overhead
- Continuing implementation of model
