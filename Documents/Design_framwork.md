# Using Natural Language Processing for Agent Evaluation

## I. Final Product
The ideal final product will be an application that takes user input – the agents, the roles, and documentation – to create an accurate agent evaluation. It will take numerous input formats: .docx, .csv, .xlsx, .txt, and .pdf. It will also allow different formats of exporting results (.csv or .txt). The application will be trained to handle a wide range of inputs.

## II. Design Components

| **Component**        | **Implementation**                                                                                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**            | - Reading formats differently depending on file extension <br> - Making a dictionary with headings/survey questions/subtitles as keys and answers/paragraphs as values <br> - Convert documents into consistent JSON objects containing source, category, and raw/extracted text <br> - Support multi-paragraph and table extraction for .docx formats <br> - Ensure duplicate or irrelevant content (e.g., empty lines or repeated sections) is filtered out |
| **Data Processing**  | - Clean and normalize text: remove unimportant characters, fix formatting, and unify case where needed <br> - Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify mentions of agents (full names, partials, or IDs) <br> - Cross-check against a provided agent list to map detected names/IDs to structured entities <br> - Avoid duplication of detected agents in a single document by checking for unique ID presence <br> - Tokenize and store processed text for downstream tasks like sentiment analysis |
| **Preparing/Labelling Data** | - Using labeled datasets from previous RBC projects <br> - Labeling larger datasets of different types (surveys, resumes, reviews, etc.) <br> - Preparing sentiment analysis <br> - Design annotation schema compatible with multiple tasks (agent identification, sentiment classification, topic tagging) <br> - Build label consistency checks and apply active learning strategies to minimize manual effort |
| **Training**         | - Implement bootstrapping workflows: iteratively train on small labeled data, apply on unlabeled data, and refine <br> - Experiment with domain-specific language models or fine-tuned transformer-based models (e.g., SpaCy, BERT) <br> - Use cross-validation and early stopping to avoid overfitting, especially with imbalanced datasets <br> - Monitor training metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) per document type |
| **Decision Making**  | - Test the model on unseen documents to evaluate agent detection accuracy <br> - Apply rule-based logic alongside statistical models for edge cases or low-confidence predictions <br> - Rank outputs (e.g., top agents per document) and provide confidence scores for human review <br> - Log false positives/negatives (for agent assignment or category) to retrain with improved feedback |
| **Output**           | - Structured Document Storage: Store documents with metadata in a document database (MongoDB) <br> - Agent-Based Retrieval: Enable fast retrieval of all documents linked to a given agent or team using indexed fields <br> - Visualization & Dashboards: Provide interactive dashboards to view trends, document categories, frequency of mentions, and model performance metrics <br> - Export & Reporting: Allow users to export reports in various formats (JSON, CSV, Excel, PDF) for analysis or presentation <br> - Feedback Loop: Embed user-facing tools to verify, correct, or approve agent-document associations, feeding updates back into training and improving data quality over time |

## III. Operations
The system operates through a structured pipeline that transforms raw documents into categorized, agent-associated records. The main operational stages include:

1. **Document Intake**
   - Documents are uploaded through a user interface or batch-processed in bulk.
   - Supported file types (e.g., .docx, .csv, .txt) are handled according to their format-specific structure.

2. **Text Extraction and Structuring**
   - Headings, questions, and tables are extracted and parsed into key-value pairs.
   - Structured representations are stored in JSON format, compatible with document-based databases.

3. **Entity Recognition and Association**
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used to detect agent names and relevant entities.
   - Each entity is validated against a reference agent list and associated accordingly.

4. **Content Classification**
   - Documents are categorized by type (e.g., resume, survey, feedback).
   - Sentiment analysis and topic modeling are applied where appropriate.

5. **Storage and Retrieval**
   - Processed documents are stored in a schema-aligned, agent-specific structure.
   - Efficient indexing supports search by agent, category, and content type.

6. **Feedback and Iterative Learning**
   - Optional human validation allows correction of misclassifications.
   - Feedback data is incorporated to retrain models, improving future performance.

## IV. Guidelines
While designing and implementing this system, there are a few guidelines that must be kept in mind throughout the process. Designing and implementing while thinking of these guidelines will ensure module coupling, maintaining data integrity, and the best possible results.

- **Scalability**: Design for Big Data. There will be thousands of agents, roles, and texts being stored and processed. Build the system to ensure that this data can be handled.
- **Performance**: There is a lot of processing required within this application. Every processing stage—parsing, classification, storage—should be optimized for efficiency. Response time and throughput are key performance metrics.
- **Data Integrity**: Clean data is essential. Redundant, irrelevant, or duplicate entries must be filtered out to ensure long-term consistency and prevent downstream issues.
- **Consistency**: The system is intended to operate autonomously. Consistent behavior must be maintained even in the face of incomplete or malformed data inputs, with proper error handling and fallbacks.
- **Accuracy**: Analysis accuracy is critical—especially for associating documents with the correct agents, mapping categories, and evaluating agent roles. Continuous validation and retraining are required to meet quality benchmarks.
- **Precision**: The system’s results should mirror human decision-making as closely as possible. High precision ensures that the outputs are contextually appropriate and meaningful.

## V. Conclusion
This project will employ a very modular approach, completely isolating components while developing and prototyping. This will allow for simpler troubleshooting, testing, and implementation of the modules. As this project relies on data, labeling the data will be the highest priority at the beginning of this project. Datasets are the lifeline of its success.

## VI. Notes
- Allow dynamic inputs for roles will allow for an extension of the database, for example:

```json
{
    "Cooperation": {
        "positive": ["Collaboration", "Teamwork", "Group Communication"],
        "negative": ["Individual", "Selfish", "Autonomous"]
    }
}
```
- Include some form of human-in-the-loop validation to catch low-confidence results early in the decision-making pipeline.
- Establish a log for predictions and manual corrections to improve model accuracy with time.
- Be mindful of system performance when scaling up the number of documents or agents.
- Always prioritize a feedback loop to ensure the model adapts to new scenarios and provides high-quality results.
- Keep the modular approach flexible to add new components or adjust existing ones as needed.
- Labeling should be an ongoing task, continually improving the dataset and enriching the model.
- Store the documents in a flexible, searchable format to allow efficient retrieval (e.g., MongoDB or Elasticsearch).
- Make the export feature as intuitive as possible to cater to users’ needs.
