# Using Natural Language Processing for Agent Evaluation  
### Requirement Analysis  
**Author:** Evan Wells  

---

## I. Description  
This application will provide a minimalist user interface that prompts users to upload documentation (resumes, surveys, customer reviews, etc.) and specify the roles to be evaluated (as determined by prior role negotiation). The backend will analyze the provided data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and evaluate each agent accordingly.

## II. Requirements

**i) Functional Requirements**
1. The application should accept files from the user.  
2. It should return an agent evaluation in the form of a Q Matrix.  
3. It must be capable of handling large amounts of input data.  
4. Users should be able to export results (e.g., Excel, JSON).  
5. The application should allow users to edit or delete agents and roles.  
6. Users should be able to re-evaluate agents after modifying roles or documents.

**ii) Technical Requirements**  
1. The application should have an intuitive interface.  
2. It should perform feature extraction and sentiment analysis.  
3. It should keep track of previous agent evaluations.  
4. It should support multiple file formats (.txt, .docx, .pdf, .json, etc.).  
5. Use embedding-based similarity models (e.g., BERT, SBERT) for semantic analysis.

**iii) Operational Requirements**  
1. The application should store all agent data.  
2. The application should store all role data.  
3. It must be highly scalable.  
4. The system should be capable of being incrementally trained or updated with new data as needed. *(Note: “Trained for every possible role-agent scenario” is unrealistic due to combinatorial complexity.)*

## III. Tentative Structure

| **Component** | **Structure** |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Frontend**  | Likely implemented with React.js for UI interactions. |
| **Backend**   | Developed in Python, using Flask or FastAPI for the API layer. |
| **Database**  | Document-based database (MongoDB) for scalable, flexible storage. |
| **NLP**       | Leverages spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers for feature extraction and model training. |
| **File Handling** | Uses `pdfplumber` and other parsers for processing various file types including scanned documents. |

## IV. Non-required Features  
These features are not essential for core functionality but would significantly enhance usability:

- **Natural Language Role Negotiation**: Extract role definitions from plain-language user input.  
- **Feedback Loop for Continuous Learning**: Allow users to manually refine the Q Matrix, and let the system learn from these corrections.  
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatically detect document language and translate as necessary.  
- **Interactive Q Matrix Visualization**: Visualize agent-role suitability using an interactive or color-coded heatmap.

## V. Challenges  
This project introduces several complex topics and development hurdles:

- **Learning and Implementing NLP Models**: Managing new libraries, model selection, and integration (e.g., Transformers, spaCy).  
- **Handling Input/Output Variability**: Dealing with various file formats and inconsistently formatted text.  
- **Scalability**: Designing the system to efficiently evaluate many agents and large documents without bottlenecks.  
- **Role Abstraction**: Supporting flexible and domain-independent role definitions.  
- **Agent Abstraction**: Ensuring agents can represent people, machines, groups, or abstract entities.  
- **Data Quality and Noise**: Handling vague, incomplete, or noisy user-submitted content.  
- **Preventing Bias**: Minimizing algorithmic or data-driven bias, especially across different demographics or document types.  
- **Integration Across Stack**: Ensuring smooth interaction between frontend (React), backend (Flask/FastAPI), database (MongoDB), and the machine learning layer.
